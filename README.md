- 👋 Hi, I’m @erfankashani , Happy to see you on my page. I am a technical engineer who enjoys tackling abstract problems and bringing ideas into reality, sometimes through writing code and other times without. My current work involves architecting and building data-intensive software solutions (distributed computing data pipelines, real-time APIs, and setting up data processing platforms).
- 👀 I’m interested in designing large-scale data products that improve people's quality of life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about vector databases, distributed model training, scaling, and serving in regards to AI applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects and technical challenges.
